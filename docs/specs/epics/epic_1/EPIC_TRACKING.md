# Epic 1 - Internationalisation (i18n)

**Status**: 📋 PLANNING
**Created**: 2025-11-16
**Target Completion**: TBD

---

## 📖 Epic Overview

### Description

This epic implements comprehensive internationalization (i18n) for the entire website, enabling full bilingual support (French/English) with seamless language switching, persistent user preferences, and SEO-optimized bilingual URLs. The implementation uses next-intl as the foundation, providing type-safe translations, automatic language detection, and integration with Next.js 15 App Router patterns including Server Components and middleware.

### Epic Objectives

- Enable bilingual UI with French and English support throughout the application
- Implement automatic language detection based on browser preferences with cookie persistence
- Create SEO-optimized bilingual URL structure (`/fr/*` and `/en/*`)
- Provide seamless content fallback when translations are missing
- Ensure proper SEO metadata with hreflang and canonical tags
- Deliver accessible language switching UI component

### User Value

Users can access the entire website in their preferred language, with the system automatically detecting their browser language and remembering their choice. When content is unavailable in their preferred language, they receive clear indicators and can easily switch to view available translations. Search engines properly index bilingual content with correct hreflang annotations, improving international discoverability.

## 🎯 Story Management

### How Stories Progress

For each story in the epic:

1. **Plan Phase** (use `/plan-story`)
   - Story spec created: `story_1_Y/story_1.Y.md`
   - Phases plan created: `story_1_Y/implementation/PHASES_PLAN.md`
   - Update this table: Set **Phases** column to phase count (e.g., "5")
   - Update **Status** to 🚧 IN PROGRESS

2. **Implement Phases** (use `phase-doc-generator` + `phase-implementer`)
   - Generate detailed phase docs
   - Implement phases one at a time
   - Update **Progress** column as each phase completes (e.g., "1/5" → "2/5" → ...)

3. **Complete Story**
   - All phases completed
   - Update **Status** to ✅ COMPLETED
   - Update **Progress** to final (e.g., "5/5")

### Quick Actions

```bash
# Initialize a story in this epic
/plan-story Epic 1 Story 1.Y

# Generate docs for a phase
/generate-phase-doc Epic 1 Story 1.Y Phase N

# Check epic progress at any time
cat docs/specs/epics/epic_1/EPIC_TRACKING.md

## 🔄 Epic Dependencies

### Dependencies Between Stories

The stories in this epic have the following dependency chain:

- **Story 1.1** (next-intl installation) must be completed before all other stories
- **Story 1.2** (message files) must be completed before Stories 1.5, 1.7, 1.8 (they need translations)
- **Story 1.3** (middleware) must be completed before Story 1.8 (architecture correction needs middleware)
- **Story 1.8** (architecture correction) absorbs Story 1.4 and must be completed before 1.5, 1.6, 1.7
- **Story 1.4** (URL structure) is BLOCKED - absorbed by Story 1.8
- Stories 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 can be implemented in parallel once Story 1.8 is complete

**Recommended Implementation Order**:

1. Story 1.1 (next-intl setup) - IN PROGRESS
2. Story 1.2 (message files) - PLANNING
3. Story 1.3 (middleware) - IN PROGRESS
4. **Story 1.8** (architecture correction + i18n pages) - NEW - absorbs 1.4
5. Stories 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 (parallel - fallback, SEO, language selector)

### External Dependencies

- Next.js 15 App Router must be set up (Epic 0)
- Route structure in `app/` directory must exist
- Basic layout and navigation components must exist
