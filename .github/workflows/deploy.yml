# GitHub Actions Workflow for Deployment to Cloudflare Workers
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow automates the deployment of the Next.js application to Cloudflare Workers.
# It serves as the final stage in the CI/CD pipeline after all quality checks pass.
#
# Triggers:
# - Manual dispatch (workflow_dispatch) for on-demand deployments
# - Automatic trigger after successful quality checks (workflow_run)
#
# Phases:
# 1. Structure (Commit 1): Workflow file setup with permissions and concurrency
# 2. Triggers (Commit 2): Add workflow_dispatch and workflow_run triggers
# 3. Deployment (Commit 3): Configure Cloudflare Workers deployment
# 4. Verification (Commit 4): Add post-deployment health checks
# 5. Logging (Commit 5): Add deployment artifacts and summary

name: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

# ============================================================================
# Triggers Configuration (Commit 2)
# ============================================================================
#
# This workflow supports two trigger mechanisms:
#
# 1. Manual Deployment (workflow_dispatch)
#    - Allows developers to trigger deployments on-demand
#    - Optional inputs for skip_verification and dry_run
#    - Useful for emergency deployments or testing
#
# 2. Automatic Deployment (workflow_run)
#    - Triggers after quality checks pass successfully
#    - Limited to main/develop branches to avoid deploying feature branches
#    - Ensures code quality before production deployment
#    - Dependency: quality workflow must complete successfully

  # 3. Install dependencies with locked versions
  # 4. Build the application (OpenNext adapter for Cloudflare Workers)
  # 5. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers using wrangler-action
  #
  # Security: Uses GitHub secrets for API token and account ID
  # Timeout: 10 minutes to prevent hanging deployments

  # Health Check Job (Commit 4: Post-Deployment Verification)
  # ============================================================================
  #
  # This job verifies that the deployed Worker is accessible and responds correctly.
  # It runs after the deployment completes successfully.
  #
  # Health Check Strategy:
  # - Target: Deployed Worker URL
  # - Method: HTTP GET request
  # - Success Criteria: HTTP 200 response
  # - Retry Logic: 3 attempts with 10-second delay between retries
  # - Purpose: Detect failed deployments (invalid code, missing dependencies, etc.)
  #
  # IMPORTANT: Rollback Procedure
  # If health check fails:
  # 1. Check Cloudflare Workers Dashboard for error logs
  # 2. Review recent deployments in Cloudflare UI
  # 3. Identify the failed deployment by timestamp
  # 4. Manually rollback to previous version using Cloudflare UI:
  #    - Go to Workers > Deploy History
  #    - Select the last successful deployment
  #    - Click "Rollback to this version"
  # 5. Investigate error logs to fix the issue
  # 6. Re-deploy with corrections
